## Description
Most of the APIs used in this project produce data 24/7/365 and its all relatively accurate.
Therefore its a good way to design systems for data ingestion.
Branched off this and into Linux territory as Windows doesnt cleanly offer most of what I needed.

l'll be breaking this down into either docker containers and/or just simpler microservices I can clone. 
Public now but I'll probably reset it back to private once thats finished so.
