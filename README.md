## Description
Most of the APIs used in this project produce data 24/7/365 and its all relatively accurate.
Therefore its a good way to design systems for data ingestion.
Branched off this and into Linux territory as Windows doesnt cleanly offer most of what I needed.

It is by no means refined right now, 
regardless I'm breaking it down into docker containers and/or just simpler microservices I can clone.
I can do that without headaches on Linux. 
Public now but I'll probably reset it back to private once thats finished.
